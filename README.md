## DE4L

The DE4L project is pursuing the development of an intelligent ecosystem as part of a platform for data exchange for logistics service companies. This is to avoid high congestion on delivery vehicles, costs due to incorrect delivery and repeated delivery and pickup attempts. The so-called “last mile” of the supply chain, meaning the exact delivery and collection of parcels at the front door, offers a great deal of potential for increasing efficiency. With the platform DE4L strengthens the cooperation of the service companies and promotes the digitization of information.
