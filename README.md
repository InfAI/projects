## AKSW
Agile Knowldge Engineering and Semantic Web research network (AKSW) is a scientific network, distributed over various universities and scientific institutes (including InfAI), whose members are involved in various national and international research and software projects. Technologies from the field of semantic web and linked data are primarily developed and evaluated. The following repository/organisation contains publicly available project artifacts for which AKSW is directly responsible.

## DE4L

The DE4L project is pursuing the development of an intelligent ecosystem as part of a platform for data exchange for logistics service companies. This is to avoid high congestion on delivery vehicles, costs due to incorrect delivery and repeated delivery and pickup attempts. The so-called “last mile” of the supply chain, meaning the exact delivery and collection of parcels at the front door, offers a great deal of potential for increasing efficiency. With the platform DE4L strengthens the cooperation of the service companies and promotes the digitization of information.

## IRPsim

IRPsim is an infrastructure for the computation of different models in the energy domain. Currently, it consists of the web-based IRPsim infrastructure and the main models IRPopt and IRPact. The IRPsim-infrastructure enables the management of input and output data in a structured database, parallelized model execution and automatic model linkage. IRPopt (Integrated Resource Planning and Optimization) is an integrated energy system optimization model. It integrates the techno-economic system aspects by simultaneously taking the roles of different actors into account. IRPact models the adoption behaviour of various heterogeneous stakeholder groups. The socio-economic entities and dynamics are based on an agent-based modelling framework and the adoption processes are empirically grounded.

## SENERGY

SENERGY is a smart service platform which enables the automated integration, (pre-)processing and analysis of sensor data. It also supports business process automation by leveraging IoT technologies and advanced data analytics, such as machine learning algorithms. The platform has been designed for cross-sectoral application possibilities (e.g. energy management, health, security, convenience and entertainment) in many different IoT scenarios.

## SEPL
SEPL is a cloud-based energy data platform which connects to different data sources, such as IoT devices, is capable of processing mass amounts of data and enables the development of digital value-added services for the energy industry based on energy production and consumption data. Furthermore, it supports the energy-efficient and automated control of machines and consumer appliances.

## TRANSIT

Within TRANSIT, a cooperation model with innovative, integrated, data trustee-supported data processing for logistics companies is being developed and implemented as a prototype in the form of a platform. The data trustee, who acts as a B2B intermediary, is intended to enable and promote closer cooperation between companies. Using the trustee, sensitive business process data is exchanged that is not or only reluctantly shared under today's conditions, such as information on loading capacities and delivery relationships.
